## 🎯 Overview

**Granola** is an advanced Playwright test automation framework that integrates **ContextGuard**, a sophisticated AI quality assurance system. This framework ensures that AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) follow strict industry best practices, architectural patterns, and security standards when assisting with test development.

### What Makes Granola Different?

Traditional test frameworks rely on developers to manually enforce quality standards. Granola revolutionizes this approach by embedding **AI guardrails** directly into the development workflow, ensuring every line of code generated by AI assistants meets enterprise-grade quality requirements.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 ContextGuard AI Quality System
- **Six Specialized Agents**: Quality, Playwright, Security, Architecture, Verification, and Integration agents
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Automatically routes development tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- **Step-by-Step Verification**: Enforces mandatory quality checkpoints throughout development
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Complex tasks trigger coordinated agent handoffs for comprehensive coverage
- **Compliance Reporting**: Every task concludes with detailed audit and validation report

### 🎭 Enterprise-Grade Test Architecture
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Enforced architectural pattern for maintainable test suites
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety and compile-time error detection
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Automated testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Authentication Management**: Shared authentication state with setup dependencies
- **CI/CD Ready**: Optimized configuration for continuous integration pipelines

### 🔒 Security-First Development
- **Credential Protection**: Automated detection of hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **Input Validation**: Enforced validation patterns for all user inputs
- **API Security**: Secure authentication and data handling practices
- **Security Audits**: Built-in security agent validates all authentication flows

### 📊 Advanced Test Infrastructure
- **Parallel Execution**: Fully parallelized test runs for maximum speed
- **Smart Retries**: Automatic retry logic for flaky test detection
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot and video capture on failures
- **Trace Debugging**: Detailed trace files for comprehensive failure analysis
- **Multiple Reporters**: HTML and console reporting with CI/CD integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Granola
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

4. **Verify installation**
```bash
npm test
```

## 📖 Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode
npm test

# Run tests with browser UI visible
npm run test:headed

# Interactive UI mode for test development
npm run test:ui

# Debug mode with Playwright Inspector
npm run test:debug
```

### Using ContextGuard with AI Assistants

Activate the ContextGuard orchestrator in Copilot Chat:

```
@workspace #file:ContextGuard-Orchestrator.md [your request]
```

**Example Requests:**
```
@workspace #file:ContextGuard-Orchestrator.md Create a LoginPage with Page Object Model
@workspace #file:ContextGuard-Orchestrator.md Build checkout flow with comprehensive tests
@workspace #file:ContextGuard-Orchestrator.md Audit security in authentication flows
@workspace #file:ContextGuard-Orchestrator.md Refactor tests following quality standards
```

The orchestrator automatically:
- ✅ Routes your request to the appropriate specialized agent(s)
- ✅ Enforces all ContextGuard quality standards
- ✅ Provides step-by-step progress updates
- ✅ Delivers comprehensive compliance reports

## 🎓 ContextGuard Agent System

### Specialized Agents

| Agent | Expertise | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Quality Agent** | Code quality, documentation, naming | Code reviews, refactoring, documentation |
| **Playwright Agent** | POM, test design, selectors | Creating page objects, writing tests |
| **Security Agent** | Credentials, validation, protection | Authentication, API security, audits |
| **Architecture Agent** | Design patterns, structure | System design, component architecture |
| **Verification Agent** | Compliance checks, audits | Code validation, standards verification |
| **Integration Agent** | Multi-domain coordination | Complex features, end-to-end workflows |

### Agent Routing Examples

**Simple Task (Single Agent):**
```
Create ProductPage → Playwright Agent
```

**Medium Task (Two Agents):**
```
Create secure LoginPage → Playwright Agent → Security Agent
```

**Complex Task (Multi-Agent):**
```
Build checkout flow → Integration Agent coordinates:
├─ Architecture Agent (design)
├─ Playwright Agent (implementation)
├─ Security Agent (payment security)
├─ Quality Agent (documentation)
└─ Verification Agent (compliance)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Playwright Configuration

The framework is configured for optimal test execution:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Test Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Expect Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Retries**: 2 retries in CI, 0 in local development
- **Parallelization**: Fully parallel execution
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Artifacts**: Traces, screenshots, and videos on failure

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for environment-specific configuration:

```env
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
CI=false
```

2. Use the Test Explorer to run and debug tests
3. Set breakpoints directly in test files

### Viewing Test Reports
```bash
# After test execution, open HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Analyzing Failures
- **Traces**: Review detailed execution traces with `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip`
- **Screenshots**: Check `test-results/` for failure screenshots
- **Videos**: Watch test recordings in `test-results/` directory
